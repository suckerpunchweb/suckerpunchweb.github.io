-=- feb 19 2021 "brain cues"
<br>
to keep things interesting while listening to music, producers will often put transitions in the middle of similar looping parts. not only does this somewhat prevent this instrumental from becomming stale, but it also cues the listener's brain to get ready for a change in the music. the opposite can be said as well, as a transition can help the song ease into a dramatic shift in style.
<br>
along with helping transitions, making the rhythmic portion of certain sounds stick out can help the brain recognize it with more ease. this is especially useful when applying it to a bass, as frequencies get harder to hear as they get lower.
<br>
ive used this technique myself by chopping off the tails of some bass notes, which increases the contrast between the bass and empty space and makes the notes easier to hear.

-=- feb 12 2021 "sampling"
<br>
after finding op1.fun, a large public sample library, i was able to replace several instruments in my original compositions with sampled ones. for instance, one of my songs used a stock midi vibraphone. using op1.fun, i was able to replace this with a rounder mellotron vibraphone sample.
i spent the last week revamping my instrumentation with more lush and stylized sounds to create this modern and vintage contrast, as i used modern percussion and synth elements intertwined with elegant strings and lo-fi textures.

-=- jan 29 2021 "intensity"
<br>
along with the actual content of a song, the mood set by the instrumental is equally important. while actual emotion is more complex, most music is defined by their intensity. ive used this quality to define my most mellow and intense points throughout my album for me to refer to, as mellow points require sweet and artistic lines, and intense points require raw and realistic lines. just like books, the "rising and falling action" plot-point map can be applied to most albums as well, and is a great structure to adhere too when attempting to create and release tension.

-=- apr 28 2021 "writers' block"
<br>
coming into this project, i wanted to make something that people wanted to listen to; i wanted to make something that was not only instrumentally entertaining, but also lyrically. while i've done some recreational writing in the past, the amount of times i've done it and the content i've produced from it makes my experience almost negligable. this was a big hurdle for me, as starting out, i had no experience writing lyrics on a major scale, as well as little to no experience writing in general.
<br>
starting out, i attempted to "brute force" write. i would sit at my desk for hours and try to write whatever i thought would be good.
<br>
this did not work at all.
<br>
after attempting and failing at writing for the first time, i realized i needed some sort of plan or outline. at this point in my writing stage, i had most of the instrumental portions of my tracks finished. i decided to mark out what i wanted each track to cover, in hopes that this would help out my flow.
<br>
this also did not work.
<br>
i was still stuck, and while i had an outline, it wasn't detailed enough. so i went further.
<br>
after creating a more thourough outline, i was pretty much set. i took time in the car and in the shower to listen to my own songs and see what i could come up with using my outline, and eventually ended up with my first completed song.
<br>
of course, beating writers' block is different for everybody, but the extra planning i ended up doing did the trick for me.
