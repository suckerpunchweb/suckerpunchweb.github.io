-=- feb 19 2021 "brain cues"
<br>
to keep things interesting while listening to music, producers will often put transitions in the middle of similar looping parts. not only does this somewhat prevent this instrumental from becomming stale, but it also cues the listener's brain to get ready for a change in the music. the opposite can be said as well, as a transition can help the song ease into a dramatic shift in style.
<br>
along with helping transitions, making the rhythmic portion of certain sounds stick out can help the brain recognize it with more ease. this is especially useful when applying it to a bass, as frequencies get harder to hear as they get lower.
<br>
ive used this technique myself by chopping off the tails of some bass notes, which increases the contrast between the bass and empty space and makes the notes easier to hear.

-=- feb 12 2021 "sampling"
<br>
after finding op1.fun, a large public sample library, i was able to replace several instruments in my original compositions with sampled ones. for instance, one of my songs used a stock midi vibraphone. using op1.fun, i was able to replace this with a rounder mellotron vibraphone sample.
i spent the last week revamping my instrumentation with more lush and stylized sounds to create this modern and vintage contrast, as i used modern percussion and synth elements intertwined with elegant strings and lo-fi textures.

-=- jan 29 2021 "intensity"
<br>
along with the actual content of a song, the mood set by the instrumental is equally important. while actual emotion is more complex, most music is defined by their intensity. ive used this quality to define my most mellow and intense points throughout my album for me to refer to, as mellow points require sweet and artistic lines, and intense points require raw and realistic lines. just like books, the "rising and falling action" plot-point map can be applied to most albums as well, and is a great structure to adhere too when attempting to create and release tension.
